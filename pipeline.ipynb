Visually and statistically, there is a linear relationship between the dependent variable (total deaths) and the independent variables. Earlier in the data exploration part, we applied the Linear Regression model and visualised the data with a pair plot to see the correlation between variables. We noted a strong relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. However, we also noted a strong correlation between a few independent variables. In this case, we could apply the feature selection technique to remove the variables. However, we do not remove anything; instead, we try the Lasso Regression because it can help to zero the least important features."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":31,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\n","from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n","from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","\n","#retrieve dataframe from preprocessing\n","%store -r df\n","\n","def rmse(a,b):\n","    return np.sqrt(np.mean((a-b)**2))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Pipeline\n","We seperated the independent variables and the target variable in two seperate lists.
